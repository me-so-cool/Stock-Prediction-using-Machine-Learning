# Stock-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This is a small program predicting stock prices of small data using standard ML algorithms. This may not be accurate and is only for the purpose of learning. The project contains three files namely *stock_pred.py*, which is the python file, *StockPrediction.docx*, which is a word file explaining the project and *reli.csv* which is the data file.

**BUILD**

To build and run the file, you need to install the [*Anaconda Navigator*](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
Then download the *reli.csv* file and paste it in a folder you'd like.
Run the *stock_pred.py* from the same folder as *reli.csv* using *SPYDER* which comes pre-installed with *Anaconda Navigator*.

**RUN**
Click the run button in the *SPYDER* to run the project. If you want to predict for a specific date, you can predict it by giving input.

Note:"DON'T input ***DATE*** directly. As we have converted date to integer(read *StockPrediction.docx* and comments). Add the integer accordingly to the last updated date in *reli.csv* and then input the corresponding integer.
